## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

# 1) Data Management Widgets  

A suite of tools designed to streamline data migration and validation between legacy systems and modern servers. This project highlights seamless integration of APIs and intuitive user interfaces to enhance operational efficiency.

## Features  

### Replica Widget  
- Facilitated data migration from an old PRIM server to a 3DS server.  
- Developed a search functionality to retrieve data from the PRIM server, displaying results in a tabular format.  
- Enabled data selection and import, creating background jobs for the migration process.  
- Implemented automated notifications upon job completion, providing a product link via email.  

### Product Validation Widget  
- Allowed drag-and-drop functionality for data imported via the Replica Widget.  
- Enabled users to modify specific fields using an "Edit" feature, with access controlled by user permissions.  

## What I Worked On  
- Designed and implemented the user interface to ensure smooth and user-friendly interactions.  
- Created Java APIs for handling server-side operations and optimized integration.  
- Utilized pre-developed integration APIs to facilitate communication between the legacy PRIM server and the 3DS server.  
- Developed front-end logic in Vue.js to interact seamlessly with the back-end services.  

## Technologies Used  
- Vue.js  
- Java

# 2) File Comparison Tool

A web application for file comparison. This tool simplifies the process of identifying differences between two files, such as XLF or plain text, and provides an easy-to-use interface for users.

## Features

### File Comparison Widget
- **File Upload:**  
  Allows users to upload two files (Old File and New File) via drag-and-drop or input selection.  
- **File Validation:**  
  Ensures files are uploaded correctly and checks if file extensions match to maintain compatibility.  
- **Smart Diffing:**  
  Utilizes `diff-match-patch` to identify differences between file contents, including semantic cleanup.  
- **Delta Preview:**  
  Displays a styled HTML preview of the file differences.  
- **Export Differences:**  
  Offers a "Download" feature to save the comparison results as a `.doc` file.  

### Reset and Alerts
- Provides a "Reset" button to clear all inputs and restore the tool to its initial state.  
- Alerts users when files with mismatched extensions are uploaded.  

## What I Worked On
- Designed the user interface using Vue.js and Vuetify.  
- Integrated `diff-match-patch` for efficient and accurate comparison of file contents.  
- Developed logic for handling XLF file-specific text extraction and semantic difference cleanup.  
- Implemented file handling mechanisms with `FileReader` to process file inputs and generate outputs dynamically.  

## Technologies Used
- Vue.js  
- Vuetify  
- `diff-match-patch`  
- JavaScript
